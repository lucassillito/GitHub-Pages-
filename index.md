# Hello Internet this is Lucas Sillito

# Early Life

I was born in Houston, Texas, where I lived for only a year or two before moving to College Station. I later spent 2 years in Japan when I was four years old, staying there with my grandparents, my mother, and my brother. My mother was pregnant with my little brother at the time, and he was actually born in Japan.

**This is a bold statement**

# Why Computer Science?

I love problem-solving, and growing up, I've always been around computers. I have grown to love them as they are a big part of my life. I've also always wanted to learn how to code, so why not go above and beyond that and become great at coding?
