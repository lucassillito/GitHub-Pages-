# Hello Internet this is Lucas Sillito

# **Early Life**


<p>I was born in Houston, Texas, where I lived for only a year or two before moving to College Station. I later spent 2 years in Japan when I was four years old, staying there with my grandparents, my mother, and my brother. My mother was pregnant with my little brother at the time, and he was actually born in Japan.<p>

<p>Growing up, I've always surrounded myself with sports. My favorites were basketball, football, and soccer. During my childhood, I played competitive football and basketball. There were times when I was a part of three different basketball teams simultaneously. I played at a high level in middle school and focused on obtaining my associate's degree in high school, which meant I didn't participate in any teams during my high school years. Now, I'm looking to train for the next year with the aim of possibly walking on to a college basketball team.<p>

<p>While growing up with sports, I was also surrounded by video games. My dad introduced them to me when I was a child, and they have stuck with me ever since. Among the various games, one in particular has remained a constant in my life: Dota 2. I've been playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dota_2">Dota 2</a> for 10 years now. It's renowned for having the largest tournament prize pools in esports, and it's one of the few MOBAs made before League of Legends that is still popular and actively played.I'm the highest rank (Immortal) in the game, and I'm also among the top 0.1% of players. <p>
